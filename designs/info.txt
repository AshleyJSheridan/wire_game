Hi George,

I've saved an updated background for the client party screen and website here for you: file://localhost/Volumes/TempDropZone/George%20Bardis/31361_TMW_client_party_screen_BG_update.psd

This should fade to a flat colour of #343434

Thanks,
Dawn



If you have time, could you add a full stop after all the headers. And also change 'gets' to 'got' on the line about winning £500 as it'll probably all be in the past by the time people see it!
